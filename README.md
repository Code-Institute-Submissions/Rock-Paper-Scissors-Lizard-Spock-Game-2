# RPSLS World
This project is a simple rock, paper, scissors, lizard and spock online game. This particular online game allows the user to play against the computer. My intended purpose for this game was to create a exciting and fun simple game without the need of a second player. 

My target audience would be for all ages. RPSLS World is a fully responsive JavaScript rock, paper, scissors, lizard and spock game that will allow users to have fun within 5 clicks.
